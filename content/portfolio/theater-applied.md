We are a group of theater-makers and performance artists who work to bring theater into all kinds of organizations looking to strengthen social fabric within their organization and outside of it. We believe theater is a tool made by and for people.

We believe embodying our stories and seeing our stories embodied changes us, opens us, holds a mirror to our communities. </span>



> *"There’s this idea that monsters don’t have reflections in a mirror. And what I’ve always thought isn’t that monsters don’t have reflections in a mirror. It’s that if you want to make a human being into a monster, deny them, at the cultural level, any reflection of themselves" - Junot Diaz*

<span style="color:black"> We inherit a legacy of boundary-breaking theater practitioners, putting the form to work to remind us of our humanity, when fear, misinformation, and misinformation threaten to besiege our light. </span>
